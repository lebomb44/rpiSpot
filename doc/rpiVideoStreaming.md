First things first. You need to expand filesystem and enable camera using Raspberry Pi configuration tool. Type the following command in console:

pi@navio: ~ $ sudo raspi-config
Raspi-config menu will appear on your screen. After changing the options press the Finish button. Expand filesystem and enable camera options require a reboot to take effect. Raspi-config will ask if you wish to reboot now when you select the Finish button.

After the installation has completed you can choose whatever platform you want to stream FPV to.
